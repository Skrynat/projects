# My Programming Projects Portfolio

## Hello World (C++)
Not an actual project, just a test to understand how GitHub works with VSCode.

## FizzBuzz (C++)
Just a regular small "Project" task that Codecademy asked me to do. Understood conditionals and logic thanks to this task.

## ðŸŽ® Text Adventure Game (C++)
**My first ACTUAL complete C++ project** - Built with only variables, conditionals, and loops (before formally learning functions!). Features multiple endings, branching narratives, and hidden Easter eggs.
